# Password-Generator

## First Section (Window Prompt Do While Loop)

 For this section of code, in accordance to the requirements of the assignment, I used a do while loop to state that there is a condition and that the loop will continue until that specific condition is meant. Within the do while loop I also including the window.prompt to determine the user's input on how long they would like the password length to be.

## Variable Sections

 For this section of code, I primarily focused on just including variables to determine the window.confirms for each type of character being included in the generator. I also included a result and character variable as to use with my if statements and result for loop later on in the code.

## If Statements

 For this section of code, I included if conditions that state if the user selects yes to the confirmation variables in the previous sections, those characters would appear as the options for the randomizer to choose from. I also included console.log statements to show that the if conditions were working properly. I left them in the code as means for someone looking at said code that they can confirm in console that the condition is being met properly. 

## For loop

 For this section of code, I input a for loop that is determining that the characters used are being properly randomized and adhering to the rules I set in terms of which characters can be called upon and the length of the password that is generated.
